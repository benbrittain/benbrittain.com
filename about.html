title: About me
---

I'm Ben Brittain. I currently reside in Rochester, NY where I attend RIT. As of 2012, I'm a second year Computer Science Major.
<br>
I'm also a <a href=http://hackerschool.com">Hacker School</a> s2012 alumni.
<br>
I had a lot of fun building this website using hakyll. Hopefully the styling isn't too bad. If you encounter anything that you feel should be changed, send me an email please!

[more to come as I figure out what I should say about myself]
