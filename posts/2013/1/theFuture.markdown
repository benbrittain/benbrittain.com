title: What will this site be?

I've long toyed around with the idea of starting a blog. To me, a blog represents a way to organize my own ideas and stimulate the minds of others. I routinely am led down an intriguing avenue of thought by a random blog post that has been aggregated by some site. I am so arrogant as to think, at least a few, of my own thoughts may do the same to others.  

So, without much ado:

Static sites. "benbrittain.com" is a 100% static site. It gets generated using hakyll and then rsynced to my hosting platform. Dynamic sites are where it's at right? Why would you ever have static files?  
 
It's simple. It's extendible. It will last (nearly) forever.  
 
A few months ago, my father tried to get me onto tumblr. He said that it would be a good way to promote my "personal brand". He even offered to design me a header (he is an artist). I balked at this idea, much to his surprise. My writing in a walled off garden? Admittedly, there are ways to get data out of tumblr, but it obviously wasn't designed for it. What happens in 10 years when tumblr has gone all myspace? Is my writing just supposed to die with it? I don't want anything I've done that I care about be out of my reach. I don't want my data locked away where I can't access it.
 
Let's go crazy. Let's think about the future. Not the near-future, the far-future, the stuff you read about in sci-fi. Pretend I can live to be 150 (maybe even more!). How many social networks, blogging platforms and other forms of content hosting, will rise and fall in that time period? Extrapolating from what I've seen in my short life? A lot. Markdown and text files. They may not be the most sexy ways of storing content, but they will last a lot longer and are more accessible than anything else I can think of.
